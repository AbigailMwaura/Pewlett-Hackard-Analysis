## Results
1) Only 7 titles are affected by retirements: Managers, Assistant Engineers, and Technique Leaders. Senior leadership members retiring are more and this includes; Senior Engineers, Senior Staff engineers, and Staff
2) Of the 7 titles there is a total number of 90,398 people retiring. Senior Staff and Engineers leading the pack with 57,668 retirements
3) The number of employees eligible for mentorship is significantly less that the retiring staff which makes the ratio 1 employee to 60 mentees

## Summary
Based on the data, PH is on a scramble to fill positions quickly and with quality employees, but the skewed ratio is going to affect how effective the transition is. A new query can be ran to determine whether there are enough existing employees to fill the senior leadership positions.
